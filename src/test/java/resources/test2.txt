YOU KNOW, YOUR MAMA AND YOUR DADDY
SAYING I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU
THEY CALL ME DIRTY FROM THE ALLEY
TILL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I GET SO TIRED OF SNEAKING AROUND
JUST TO GET TO YOUR BACK DOOR
I CRAWLED PAST THE GARBAGE AND YOUR MAMA JUMPED OUT
SCREAMIN' "DON'T COME BACK NO MORE."
I CAN NOT TAKE IT
MY GUITAR WANTS TO KILL YOUR MAMA
MY GUITAR WANTS TO KILL YOUR MAMA
MY GUITAR WANTS TO BURN YOUR DAD
I GET REAL MEAN WHEN HE MAKES ME MAD
