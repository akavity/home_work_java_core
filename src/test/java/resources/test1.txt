You know, your mama and your daddy
Saying I'm no good for you
They call me dirty from the alley
Till I don't know what to do
I get so tired of sneaking around
Just to get to your back door
I crawled past the garbage and your mama jumped out
Screamin' "Don't come back no more."
I can not take it
My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to kill your mama
My guitar wants to burn your dad
I get real mean when he makes me mad
